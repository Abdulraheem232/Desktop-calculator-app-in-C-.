## Project Overview

This project is a **basic calculator** developed in C# using the **Windows Forms** framework. The app evaluates basic arithmetic expressions entered by the user and displays the result on the same window.

### Key Components:
- **Buttons for digits and operators**: These allow the user to input numbers and mathematical operations.
- **Display Area**: The results are displayed in a `TextBox` that is set to read-only to prevent user modifications directly.
- **Functionality**: The app evaluates the mathematical expression typed by the user and shows the output after pressing the "=" button.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of C# and Windows Forms for creating a functional desktop application.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: 
    - Addition (`+`)
    - Subtraction (`-`)
    - Multiplication (`*`)
    - Division (`/`)
- **Clear Button**: Clears the display when clicked.
- **Fixed Window Size**: The window size is fixed to prevent resizing.
- **Non-editable Textbox**: The textbox used to display results is set to read-only.
